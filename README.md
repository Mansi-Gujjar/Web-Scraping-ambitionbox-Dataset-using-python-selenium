# Web-Scraping-ambitionbox-Dataset-using-python-selenium

🏢 AmbitionBox Company Scraper

A small learning project built using Python, Selenium & BeautifulSoup to scrape company data from AmbitionBox.

✨ About This Project

This is a beginner-friendly web scraping project I made while learning how to extract data from dynamic websites.

Using Selenium, the script automatically opens the AmbitionBox website (which lists top Indian companies) and BeautifulSoup helps extract all visible company details from the rendered HTML.

The goal of this project was to understand real-world data scraping — from automating browsers and handling JavaScript-loaded content to parsing HTML and structuring the data into clean tables using pandas.

⚙️ What It Does

The scraper automatically:

🌐 Opens the AmbitionBox company listing page
⏳ Waits for all content to load (since it’s JavaScript-rendered)

🧭 Extracts important details such as:

🏢 Company name

⭐ Rating

💬 Number of reviews

🧩 Company type

📍 Headquarters location

💰 Average salary info
